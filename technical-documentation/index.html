                            <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</p>
                            <p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.</p>
                            <p>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="strong">CSS saves time</span> − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</li>
                            <li><span class="strong">Pages load faster</span> − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</li>
                            <li><span class="strong">Easy maintenance</span> − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
                            <li><span class="strong">Superior styles to HTML</span> − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
                            <li><span class="strong">Multiple Device Compatibility</span> − Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.</li>
                            <li><span class="strong">Global web standards</span> − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.</li>

                            <p>A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document. A style rule is made of three parts −</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="strong">Selector</span> − A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be any tag like &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;table&gt; etc.</li>
                                <li><span class="strong">Property</span> − A property is a type of attribute of HTML tag. Put simply, all the HTML attributes are converted into CSS properties. They could be color, border etc.</li>
                                <li><span class="strong">Value</span> − Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can have value either red or #F1F1F1 etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You can put CSS Style Rule Syntax as follows −</p>
                            <code>selector { property: value }</code>
                            <p><span class="strong">Example</span> − You can define a table border as follows −</p>
                            <code>table { border :1px solid #C00; }</code>
                            <p>Here table is a selector and border is a property and given value 1px solid #C00 is the value of that property.</p>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section id="Types_of_Selectors" class="main-section">
                        <header>Types of Selectors</header>
                        <div class="section-body selectors-body">
                            <p>You can define selectors in various simple ways based on your comfort. CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. Let me put these selectors one by one.</p>
                            <h3 class="selectors">The Type Selectors</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">This is the same selector we have seen above. Again, one more example to give a color to all level 1 headings −</p>
                            <code><pre>
h1 {
    color: #36CFFF;
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <h3 class="selectors">The Universal Selectors</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">Rather than selecting elements of a specific type, the universal selector quite simply matches the name of any element type −</p>
                            <code><pre>
* { 
   color: #000000; 
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">This rule renders the content of every element in our document in black.</p>
                            <h3 class="selectors">The Descendant Selectors</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">Suppose you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a particular element. As given in the following example, style rule will apply to &lt;em&gt; element only when it lies inside &lt;ul&gt; tag.</p>
                            <code><pre>
ul em {
   color: #000000; 
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <h3 class="selectors">The Class Selectors</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">You can define style rules based on the class attribute of the elements. All the elements having that class will be formatted according to the defined rule.</p>
                            <code><pre>
.black {
   color: #000000; 
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">This rule renders the content in black for every element with class attribute set to black in our document. You can make it a bit more particular. For example −</p>
                            <code><pre>
h1.black {
   color: #000000; 
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">This rule renders the content in black for only &lt;h1&gt; elements with class attribute set to black.</p>
                            <p class="top-margin">You can apply more than one class selectors to given element. Consider the following example −</p>
                            <code><pre>
&lt;p class = "center bold"&gt;
   This para will be styled by the classes center and bold.
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
                            </code>
                            <h3 class="selectors">The ID Selectors</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">You can define style rules based on the id attribute of the elements. All the elements having that id will be formatted according to the defined rule.</p>
                            <code><pre>
#black {
   color: #000000; 
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">This rule renders the content in black for every element with id attribute set to black in our document. You can make it a bit more particular. For example −</p>
                            <code><pre>
h1#black {
   color: #000000; 
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">This rule renders the content in black for only &lt;h1&gt; elements with id attribute set to black.</p>
                            <p class="top-margin">The true power of id selectors is when they are used as the foundation for descendant selectors, For example −</p>
                            <code><pre>
#black h2 {
   color: #000000; 
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">In this example all level 2 headings will be displayed in black color when those headings will lie with in tags having id attribute set to black.</p>
                            <h3 class="selectors">The Child Selectors</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">You have seen the descendant selectors. There is one more type of selector, which is very similar to descendants but have different functionality. Consider the following example −</p>
                            <code><pre>
body > p {
   color: #000000; 
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">This rule will render all the paragraphs in black if they are direct child of &lt;body&gt; element. Other paragraphs put inside other elements like &lt;div&gt; or &lt;td&gt; would not have any effect of this rule.</p>
                            <h3 class="selectors">The Attribute Selectors</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">You can also apply styles to HTML elements with particular attributes. The style rule below will match all the input elements having a type attribute with a value of text −</p>
                            <code><pre>
input[type = "text"] {
   color: #000000; 
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">The advantage to this method is that the &lt;input type = "submit" /&gt; element is unaffected, and the color applied only to the desired text fields.</p>
                            <p class="top-margin">There are following rules applied to attribute selector.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>p[lang] − Selects all paragraph elements with a lang attribute.</li>
                                <li>p[lang="fr"] − Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute has a value of exactly "fr".</li>
                                <li>p[lang~="fr"] − Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute contains the word "fr".</li>
                                <li>p[lang|="en"] − Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute contains values that are exactly "en", or begin with "en-".</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 class="selectors">Multiple Style Rules</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">You may need to define multiple style rules for a single element. You can define these rules to combine multiple properties and corresponding values into a single block as defined in the following example −</p>
                            <code><pre>
h1 {
   color: #36C;
   font-weight: normal;
   letter-spacing: .4em;
   margin-bottom: 1em;
   text-transform: lowercase;
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">Here all the property and value pairs are separated by a semicolon (;). You can keep them in a single line or multiple lines. For better readability, we keep them in separate lines.</p>
                            <p class="top-margin">For a while, don't bother about the properties mentioned in the above block. These properties will be explained in the coming chapters and you can find complete detail about properties in CSS References</p>
                            <h3 class="selectors">Grouping Selectors</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">You can apply a style to many selectors if you like. Just separate the selectors with a comma, as given in the following example −</p>
                            <code><pre>
h1, h2, h3 {
   color: #36C;
   font-weight: normal;
   letter-spacing: .4em;
   margin-bottom: 1em;
   text-transform: lowercase;
}</pre>
                            </code>
                            <p class="top-margin">This define style rule will be applicable to h1, h2 and h3 element as well. The order of the list is irrelevant. All the elements in the selector will have the corresponding declarations applied to them.</p>
                            <p class="top-margin">You can combine the various id selectors together as shown below −</p>
                            <code><pre>
#content, #footer, #supplement {
   position: absolute;
   left: 510px;
   width: 200px;
}</pre>
                            </code>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section id="How_to_Add_CSS?" class="main-section">

                            <p>CSS is added to HTML pages to format the document according to information in the style sheet. When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.</p>
                            <p>There are three ways to insert CSS in HTML documents.</p>
                            <h3 class="add-css">Inline CSS</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">We can apply CSS in a single element by inline CSS technique. The inline CSS is also a method to insert style sheets in HTML document. This method mitigates some advantages of style sheets so it is advised to use this method sparingly.</p>
                            <p class="top-margin">If you want to use inline CSS, you should use the style attribute to the relevant tag.</p>
                            <code>&lt;p style="color:blue"&gt;Hello CSS&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                            <h3 class="add-css">Internal CSS</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">Internal CSS is used to apply CSS on a single document or page. It can affect all the elements of the page.</p>
                            <p class="top-margin">It is defined in &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML page inside the &lt;style&gt; tag.</p>
                            <code><pre>
&lt;style&gt;
p {
    color: blue;
}  
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>
                            </code>
                            <h3 class="add-css">External CSS</h3>
                            <p class="top-margin">The external style sheet is generally used when you want to make changes on multiple pages. It is ideal for this condition because it facilitates you to change the look of the entire web site by changing just one file.</p>
                            <p class="top-margin">Its extension must be .css for example style.css.</p>

                        <p>A CSS comment is used to add explanatory notes to the code or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the style sheet. By design, comments have no effect on the layout of a document.</p>
                        <p>CSS comments are generally written to explain your code. It is very helpful for the users who reads your code so that they can easily understand the code.</p>
                        <code>/* Comment */</code>
                        <p>Comments can be placed wherever white space is allowed within a style sheet. They can be used on a single line, or traverse multiple lines.</p>

                        <header>Margin vs. Padding</header>
                        <p>During the designing of user interfaces, sometimes there is confusion occurs between padding and margin. They are used to provide extra space or a gap. Both margin and padding targets the four sides of an element and can also work without the border property, but they differ in many ways.</p>
                        <p>The main difference between the padding and margin is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="strong">Padding</span> provides the space between the border and the content of an element.</li>
                            <li><span class="strong">Margin</span> provides the space between the border and outer elements.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>So, when we require the space between the elements, then it is better to use margin, and when we need the space between the inner element and the parent box, then go for padding.</p>

                        <p>CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they're positioned relative to the following factors: their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, and the main viewport/window.</p>
                        <p>The page layout techniques are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Normal flow</li>
                            <li>The display property</li>
                            <li>Flexbox</li>
                            <li>Grid</li>
                            <li>Floats</li>
                            <li>Positioning</li>
                            <li>Table layout</li>
                            <li>Multiple-column layout</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages. No technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what each layout method is designed for you'll be in a good position to understand which method is most appropriate for each task.</p>

                        <header>CSS vs. CSS3</header>
                        <p>CSS works with HTML and provides a basic style and look to the website. CSS3 is the latest version of CSS. CSS3 provides JavaScript and mobile development features with additional features such as transitions, gradients, and more.</p>
                        <p>Let us discuss some of the major difference between CSS and CSS3:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The main difference between CSS and CSS3 is that CSS3 has modules.CSS is the basic version, and it does not support responsive design. CSS3, on the other hand, is the latest version and supports responsive design.</li>
                            <li>CSS cannot be split into modules, but CSS3 can be split into modules. Being an older version of CSS is slower than CSS3.</li>
                            <li>In addition to these, CSS3 has many alignment features. CSS3 provides a box-sizing tool that allows the user to get the correct size of any element without making any changes in the element’s dimensions or padding. CSS does not have any box-sizing tool, and hence the user needs to use the standard procedures defined to align text.</li>
                            <li>The animations and 3D transformations are better in CSS3. Elements can be moved on the screen with the help of flash and JavaScript. Using this, the elements will also be able to change their size and color. All kinds of transitions, transformations, and animations can be done using CSS3. CSS does not provide 3D animation and transformations.</li>
                            <li>CSS provides basic color schema and standard colors. CSS3 supports RGBA, HSLA, HSL and gradient colours. It also supports rounded image corners for text boxes.</li>
                            <li>Multi-column text blocks can be defined in CSS3. CSS only supports single text blocks.</li>
                        </ul>
